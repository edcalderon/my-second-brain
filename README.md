# My Second Brain

A personal knowledge laboratory leveraged by Obsidian as the markdown foundation, designed for agentic intelligence and deep reflection.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Blueprint

This repository serves as the orchestrator for a "Second Brain" system that bridges human thought, digital organization, and agentic execution.

### 1. Markdown Foundation (Obsidian)
- **Role**: Primary document gathering and knowledge vault.
- **Implementation**: Uses Obsidian's local-first markdown structure for maximum portability and human readability.

### 2. Contextual Intelligence (Supermemory)
- **Role**: Provides long-term memory and contextual grounding for AI agents.
- **Workflow**: Obsidian notes are ingested into Supermemory to build a dense knowledge graph.

### 3. Agent Orchestration (Open Code / Oh My OpenCode)
- **Role**: The "CPU" of the second brain.
- **Implementation**: Leverages [Oh My OpenCode](https://github.com/open-code-orchestrator) to orchestrate specialized agents that process, synthesize, and act upon the foundation documents.

### 4. Human Manual Gathering (Rocketbook)
- **Role**: Captures analog thoughts and daily reflections via handwriting.
- **Integration**: Handwritten notes are transcribed and pushed into the digital garden automatically.

## 📅 Ignatian Habit Tracker

A core component of this system is the **Ignatian Habit Tracker**, processed through Rocketbook manual gathering. It focuses on three daily reflection questions:

1. **What wrong did I do?**
   - *Recognition of faults, sins, or harmful habits.*
2. **What good did I accomplish?**
   - *Gratitude for actions, growth, and grace.*
3. **What did I forget or fail to do?**
   - *Awareness of omissions and missed duties.*

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1**: Finalize IMAP ingestion for Rocketbook reflections.
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Deep integration between Obsidian vault and Supermemory graph.
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Deploy Oh My OpenCode orchestrator for automated note processing.
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Implement specialized agents for specific knowledge domains (e.g., Development, Philosophy, Trading).
