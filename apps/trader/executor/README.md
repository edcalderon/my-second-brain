# Trader Executor (Scaffold)

Live execution app scaffold for the Binance Futures rewrite.

## Role
- Consume strategy intents
- Apply risk checks
- Execute orders through `@ed/exchange-binance-futures`

## Current Status
This workspace is intentionally scaffold-only. The production execution loop will be added incrementally.
